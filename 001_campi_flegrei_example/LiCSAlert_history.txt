Failed to open the config file for this volcano.  Trying to populate the LiCSAlert_settings and ICASAR_settings dictionaries with from the function input arguments 
LiCSAlert is opening a LiCSBAS directory.  
Succesfully referenced the LiCSBAS time series using the pixel/area selected by LiCSBAS.  
LiCSAlert removed 'cumulative' from 'displacement_r2' as it expects only the incremental displacements.  
This interferogram timeseries has 326 times and 8533 pixels.  
The data have been mean centered in space for use with sICA
Interferogram were originally (181, 281) (34356 unmasked pixels), but have been downsampled to (90, 140) (8533 unmasked pixels) for use with LiCSAlert, and have been downsampled to (45, 70) (2127 unmasked pixels) for figures.  
Only the last LiCSAlert figure has been requested, so removing any previous figures from the LiCSAlert status dictionary.

LiCSAlert status:  1) Run ICASAR: False   2) Run LiCSAlert: True
Updating masks and ICA sources.  Of the 8533 in the sources and 8533 in the current LiCSBAS time series, 8533 are in both and can be used in this iteration of LiCSAlert.  
Running LiCSAlert for 20210912
There are 326 times (set by time_values), which agrees with the  58 interferograms in ifgs_baseline and 268 in ifgs_monitoring.

Failed to open the config file for this volcano.  Trying to populate the LiCSAlert_settings and ICASAR_settings dictionaries with from the function input arguments 
LiCSAlert is opening a LiCSBAS directory.  
Succesfully referenced the LiCSBAS time series using the pixel/area selected by LiCSBAS.  
LiCSAlert removed 'cumulative' from 'displacement_r2' as it expects only the incremental displacements.  
This interferogram timeseries has 326 times and 8533 pixels.  
The data have been mean centered in space for use with sICA
Interferogram were originally (181, 281) (34356 unmasked pixels), but have been downsampled to (90, 140) (8533 unmasked pixels) for use with LiCSAlert, and have been downsampled to (45, 70) (2127 unmasked pixels) for figures.  
Only the last LiCSAlert figure has been requested, so removing any previous figures from the LiCSAlert status dictionary.

LiCSAlert is opening a LiCSBAS directory.  
Succesfully referenced the LiCSBAS time series using the pixel/area selected by LiCSBAS.  
LiCSAlert removed 'cumulative' from 'displacement_r2' as it expects only the incremental displacements.  
This interferogram timeseries has 326 times and 17568 pixels.  
The data have been mean centered in time for use with tICA
Interferogram were originally (201, 401) (70711 unmasked pixels), but have been downsampled to (100, 200) (17568 unmasked pixels) for use with LiCSAlert, and have been downsampled to (50, 100) (4385 unmasked pixels) for figures.  
Only the last LiCSAlert figure has been requested, so removing any previous figures from the LiCSAlert status dictionary.

Running ICASAR.
From the data passed to ICASAR, I understand it to be spatial data (e.g. time series of images)
As 'lons' and 'lats' have been provided, the ICs will be geocoded.  
With tica (tICA),  only the cumulative ifgs can be used.  Updating the ifgs_format setting to reflect this.  
For tICA, the cumulative interferograms are required.  These will be calculated from the incremental (daisy chain) interferograms.  
Creating all possible variations of the time series (incremental/daisy chain, cumulative, and all possible).  
When creating all interferograms, 59 were passed to the function, and these were found to make 1 connected networks.  From these, 1000 interferograms were created.  
This interferogram timeseries has 59 times and 17568 pixels.  
This interferogram timeseries has 1000 times and 17568 pixels.  
This interferogram timeseries has 59 times and 17568 pixels.  
Performing PCA to whiten the data....Starting to create the 02_PCA_sources_correlations figure:
Updating masks and ICA sources.  Of the 17568 in the sources and 18659 in the current LiCSBAS time series, 17483 are in both and can be used in this iteration of LiCSAlert.

Done.  
No results were found for the multiple ICA runs, so these will now be performed.
