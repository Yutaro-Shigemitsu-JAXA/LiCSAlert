LiCSAlert is being run for 001_campi_flegrei_example at 01/03/2024 11:40:48
LiCSAlert is opening a LiCSBAS directory.  
Opening the LiCSBAS unfiltered results.  
Succesfully referenced the LiCSBAS time series using the pixel/area selected by LiCSBAS.  
LiCSAlert removed 'cumulative' from 'displacement_r2' as it expects only the incremental displacements.  
This interferogram timeseries has 326 times and 7873 pixels.  
Interferogram were originally (181, 281) (31766 unmasked pixels), but have been downsampled to (90, 140) (7873 unmasked pixels) for use with LiCSAlert, and have been downsampled to (45, 70) (1965 unmasked pixels) for figures.  

As the baseline_end date did not lie on an acquisition date, it has been updated so that it does.  Previously, it was 20170101, but it is now 20161231

Running ICASAR.
From the data passed to ICASAR, I understand it to be spatial data (e.g. time series of images)
As 'lons' and 'lats' have been provided, the ICs will be geocoded.  
For tICA, the cumulative interferograms are required.  These will be calculated from the incremental (daisy chain) interferograms.  
Creating all possible variations of the time series (incremental/daisy chain, cumulative, and all possible).  
When creating all interferograms, 59 were passed to the function, and these were found to make 1 connected networks.  From these, 1000 interferograms were created.  
This interferogram timeseries has 59 times and 7873 pixels.  
This interferogram timeseries has 1000 times and 7873 pixels.

Done.  
No results were found for the multiple ICA runs, so these will now be performed.

Running LiCSAlert for 20210912 (acquisition # 326 of 326) : monitoring date





LiCSAlert is being run for 001_campi_flegrei_example at 09/03/2024 14:55:03
LiCSAlert is opening a LiCSBAS directory.  
Opening the LiCSBAS unfiltered results.  
Succesfully referenced the LiCSBAS time series using the pixel/area selected by LiCSBAS.  
LiCSAlert removed 'cumulative' from 'displacement_r2' as it expects only the incremental displacements.  
This interferogram timeseries has 326 times and 7873 pixels.  
Interferogram were originally (181, 281) (31766 unmasked pixels), but have been downsampled to (90, 140) (7873 unmasked pixels) for use with LiCSAlert, and have been downsampled to (45, 70) (1965 unmasked pixels) for figures.  

As the baseline_end date did not lie on an acquisition date, it has been updated so that it does.  Previously, it was 20170101, but it is now 20161231
