This interferogram timeseries has 343 times and 7015 pixels.  
Interferogram were originally (151, 221) (28020 unmasked pixels), but have been downsampled to (76, 110) (7015 unmasked pixels) for use with LiCSAlert, and have been downsampled to (38, 55) (1748 unmasked pixels) for figures.  
Only the last LiCSAlert figure has been requested, so removing any previous figures from the LiCSAlert status dictionary.

LiCSAlert status:  1) Run ICASAR: True   2) Run LiCSAlert: True

Running ICASAR.
From the data passed to ICASAR, I understand it to be spatial data (e.g. time series of images)
As 'lons' and 'lats' have been provided, the ICs will be geocoded.  
With tica (tICA),  only the cumulative ifgs can be used.  Updating the ifgs_format setting to reflect this.  
For tICA, the cumulative interferograms are required.  These will be calculated from the incremental (daisy chain) interferograms.  
Creating all possible variations of the time series (incremental/daisy chain, cumulative, and all possible).  
When creating all interferograms, 59 were passed to the function, and these were found to make 1 connected networks.  From these, 1000 interferograms were created.  
This interferogram timeseries has 59 times and 7015 pixels.  
This interferogram timeseries has 1000 times and 7015 pixels.  
This interferogram timeseries has 59 times and 7015 pixels.  
Performing PCA to whiten the data....There are negative values in the eigenvalues.  This is a tricky problem, but is usually only caused by poor approximations to zero by floating point arithmetic.  Trying to set these to a better approxiation of zero to contiue.  
Starting to create the 02_PCA_sources_correlations figure:
Updating masks and ICA sources.  Of the 7015 in the sources and 7091 in the current LiCSBAS time series, 6982 are in both and can be used in this iteration of LiCSAlert.  
    Starting to calculate the 2D kernel density estimates for the signals.  Completed 0 1 2 3 4 

    Starting to calculate the 2D kernel density estimates for the signals.  Completed 0 1 2 3 4 

Done.  
No results were found for the multiple ICA runs, so these will now be performed.

Running LiCSAlert for 20211223 (# 343 of 344)
There are 343 times (set by time_values), which agrees with the  58 interferograms in ifgs_baseline and 285 in ifgs_monitoring.
